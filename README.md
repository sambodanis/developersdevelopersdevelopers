A Steve Ballmer inspired programming language named developers

Included is an example file, the 'hello world' of the developers language

To run the example:
```
$ python devlang.py hello.developers rundev
```

To create a .developers verison of an existing file:
```
$ python devlang.py original_file.ext todev
```

To convert a .developers file to it's original contents:
```
$ python devlang.py file.developers fromdev
```

Note, your files will never be overwritten. Instead a similarly named file is generated with an underscore appended to its name.
